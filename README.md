*2D game that mimics "World's hardest game" with few twists."*

The project guides the player through the menu, specifically instructions on how to play are presented in the "How to play" section of the menu. Use the joystick to scroll through menu options or to navigate towards submenus.

The game consists of 4 rooms which you will have to get through if you want to get to the ending and potentially earn yourself a place in the "Highscores" section/hall of fame. Each room contains a difficult obstacle
that you have to push past in order to get to keys that will open your pathway to the next rooms. Touching an enemy will reset you to the last checkpoint you've touched. The objective is to die as little as possible.

The ending screen will let you know how well you've done, as in, if you've earned your spot in the highscores section. Highscores are saved in EEPROM, so your highscore will persist throughout many boot-ups of the game, and potentially knock off other highscores, since only the top 5 are saved. Set your name in the settings if you want to be remembered as a specific combination of 4 letters
